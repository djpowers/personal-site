## Who am I?!

I'm [@dave_powers](https://twitter.com/dave_powers), a web developer, humor writer, and interrobang advocate. Check out what I'm up to [now](now).

I like simple, modern, websites. This one is being built out from scratch with no frameworks or libraries to keep things as light as possible. If you're curious, here's what I like to [use](uses).

Check out some of my [writing](writing) if you'd like. You may have seen some of my humor published on [McSweeney's](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/dave-powers), [Points in Case](https://www.pointsincase.com/author/dave-powers), or [Slackjaw via Medium](https://medium.com/@dave_powers).

I grew up in the 'burbs of Boston, and bounce around Somerville and Cambridge these days. You may catch me in one of the many squares seeing a show, grabbing a beer, or [disarming a bank robber](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/01/man-who-bumped-into-bank-robbery-suspect-says-was-position-react/c7AV2FzhgOBq1iiifW0zpI/story.html).
