I'm Dave Powers ([~~Twitter~~](https://twitter.com/dave_powers), <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@davepowers">Mastodon</a>), a web developer, humor writer, and maybe a third thing. Check out what I'm up to [now](now/).

I like simple, modern, websites. Hopefully this one meets those criteria. If you're curious, here's some of what I [use](uses/) to make things.

Check out my [writing](writing/) if you'd like. My favorite humor pieces have been published on [McSweeney's](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/dave-powers), [Points in Case](https://www.pointsincase.com/author/dave-powers), and [Slackjaw via Medium](https://medium.com/@dave_powers).

I'm based in Boston, and previously spent several lovely years in Somerville. You might find me in the neighborhood catching a show, out on a run, or [disarming a bank robber](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/01/man-who-bumped-into-bank-robbery-suspect-says-was-position-react/c7AV2FzhgOBq1iiifW0zpI/story.html).
