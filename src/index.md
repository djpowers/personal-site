I'm Dave Powers ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/dave_powers), <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@davepowers">Mastodon</a>), a web developer, humor writer, and interrobang advocate. Check out what I'm up to [now](now/).

I like simple, modern, websites. Hopefully this one meets those criteria. If you're curious, here's what I like to [use](uses/) to make things.

Check out some of my [writing](writing/) if you'd like. You may have seen some of my humor published on [McSweeney's](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/dave-powers), [Points in Case](https://www.pointsincase.com/author/dave-powers), or [Slackjaw via Medium](https://medium.com/@dave_powers).

I grew up in the 'burbs of Boston, and after a lengthy tenure in the city of Somerville, I've moved across the river to Jamaica Plain. You may find me in the neighborhood catching a show, grabbing a beer, or [disarming a bank robber](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/01/man-who-bumped-into-bank-robbery-suspect-says-was-position-react/c7AV2FzhgOBq1iiifW0zpI/story.html).
