# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

Lots of stuff in the works. Current focus is upgrading the home office, which has now finally been painted.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## üëü Running

Participating in a local turkey trot 5K this Thanksgiving. Trying a new race to mix things up.

## üì∫ Watching

Finished watching _Squid Game_, which overall was great. Recommended if you like your entertainment to cause extreme anxiety. Have also been watching the latest season of _The Great British Baking Show_ as a palette cleanser.

## üìö Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_.
