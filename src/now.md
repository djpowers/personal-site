# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to make your own!)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

Full-time work going well. Finally started posting to the [blog](/blog/) section of this site, with more to come. Also just added a first pass at a new color scheme for the site (dark mode by default).

Hoping to knock out drafts soon for some short humor ideas I've been kicking around. Also overhauling my keyboard shortcuts via the [hyper key](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/hyper-key/), which I hope to write about soon.

Also starting brainstorming for the forthcoming wedding website!

## üëü Running

I've been branching out from my local [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/) course, and have been checking out events in other cities while traveling. Definitely hoping to continue doing so on future trips, schedule permitting.

## üì∫ Watching

Running through _Baby Reindeer_ on Netflix. (Feels like I'm already behind even though it just came out, but I digress.)

Also watched the first sesaon of _Girls 5 Eva_, which I hadn't heard of since Netflix picked it up. Hilarious and well-written, criminally underrated.

## üìö Reading

Picked up _Slow AF Run Club_ by Martinus Evans after going to his book tour stop in Boston. Loved his running philosophy and sense of humor, so excited to crack this one open.
