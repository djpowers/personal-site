# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

Currently mulling around another side project in my head, which comes at a good time because the domain name for a previous idea I made little progress on is about to expire.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## üëü Running

Just ran my first twilight 5K race since... possibly ever? Also was a fundraiser not put on by a for-profit events company, which was a refreshing change of pace.

## üì∫ Watching

Started _The Dropout_ on Hulu which is great so far, with a surprisingly good soundtrack to boot.

Also have finally started _Mr. Robot_, which was previously on my "shows I know I will like but have not yet watched for some reason" list.

## üìö Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_. Slowing making progress on _Your Computer is on Fire_ as well.
