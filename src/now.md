# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

Just pushed a humor piece I'm proud of over the line, which should likely be published some time in early November.

I'm also focused on building out this site. I initially wanted to do so from scratch, but realized that is not really practical for modern front-end web development. The [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) have been intriguing to me of late, so I decided to leverage [Eleventy 🎈🐀](https://www.11ty.dev/) for basic templating and build steps. It doesn't add any code to the final output that I didn't write, which was a goal of mine.

Leaning into static sites by building out a site for a friend's upcoming podcast using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and assisting another get a blog up and running via [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Will share more when there's something concrete to share. 📰 🎧

## 👟 Running

This is my favorite time of year to run. I also got a few pairs of the same running shorts I liked that were a nice investment.

## 📺 Watching

Casually have been revisiting _Sister, Sister_, which holds up surprisingly well. I also finally dipped my toes into the _Unsolved Mysteries_ reboot, and it's probably for the best that I hadn't gone down this rabbit hole until now. 🐰🕳

## 📚 Reading

Still working through _How To Write Funny_ by Scott Dikkers. I just received _The 99% Invisible City_ and _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy, and I'm excited to go through both.
