# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

Eagerly awaiting the arrival of my new mechanical keyboard, which I expect to yield a thousound-fold increase in my productivity.

The [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) have been intriguing to me of late, so I decided to leverage [Eleventy 🎈🐀](https://www.11ty.dev/) for this site. It doesn't add any code to the final output that I didn't write, which was a goal of mine.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## 👟 Running

This is my favorite time of year to run. I also got a few pairs of the same running shorts I liked that were a nice investment.

## 📺 Watching

Casually have been revisiting _Sister, Sister_, which holds up surprisingly well. I also finally dipped my toes into the _Unsolved Mysteries_ reboot, and it's probably for the best that I hadn't gone down this rabbit hole until now. 🐰🕳

Nim got me hooked on _The Great British Baking Show_, to my surprise. It's just so wholesome and pleasant. Reminder that if you are American, it is incorrect to refer to the program as _The Great British Bake Off_ because Pillsbury owns the rights to the phrase “Bake-Off” in the U.S. so I hope you get sued for any infractions.

## 📚 Reading

Still working through _How To Write Funny_ by Scott Dikkers. I just received _The 99% Invisible City_ and _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy, and I'm excited to go through both.
