# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

<mark>I'm currently looking for full-time work!</mark> Seeking a role as a Senior Software Engineer doing full-stack web development. My preferred technologies are Ruby on Rails and React, but I'm open to learning the right tool for the job. Please [get in touch](/contact) if you're hiring!

## üëü Running

Over the summer I finally invested in a Garmin watch (Forerunner model) and while not perfect, it's definitely upgraded my training. Currently gearing up for my first half marathon in a few years this fall.

## üì∫ Watching

Most recently finished watching _Beef_, which was an incredible ride. Hoping this season exists as a standalone story, although I could see the show working as an anthology series.

Next on the list are the second seasons of _The Bear_ and _White Lotus_ (admittedly lagging, no spoilers please!).

## üìö Reading

Slowly making my way through _The Address Book_, which is right up my alley. I believe I heard author Deirdre Mask on two separate podcasts before being convinced to special order a copy from my local bookstore.
