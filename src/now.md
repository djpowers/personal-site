# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

Unfortunately, I've been caught up in the latest wave of layoffs related to COVID-19. I'm planning to take some time to figure out what makes sense for me in terms of the next stage of my career, but if you have any leads you can [reach out on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davejpowers/) (feel free to mention you came from this site).

I'm also focused on building out this site. I initially wanted to do so from scratch, but realized that is not really practical for modern front-end web development. The [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) have been intriguing to me of late, so I decided to leverage [Eleventy 🎈🐀](https://www.11ty.dev/) for basic templating and build steps. It doesn't add any code to the final output that I didn't write, which was a goal of mine.

Leaning into static sites by building out a site for a friend's upcoming podcast using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and assisting another get a blog up and running via [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Will share more when there's something concrete to share. 📰 🎧

## 👟 Running

I've eased up on the mileage after [running the NYC Marathon](https://results.nyrr.org/event/M2019/result/12697) last fall. Looking forward to running the BAA 5K next (since postponed until September).

## 📺 Watching

The only show I watch in (near) real-time is Better Call Saul, which is back. I'm very close to declaring it as good as Breaking Bad. I'm also slowly making my way back through Portlandia, one of the best sketch shows of the last decade.

## 📚 Reading

Have been on a non-fiction kick for a while. Just finished [Modern Web Development on the JAMstack](https://www.netlify.com/oreilly-jamstack/), and now partway through "How To Write Funny" by Scott Dikkers.
