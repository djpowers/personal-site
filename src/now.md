# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

Currently mulling around another side project in my head, which comes at a good time because the domain name for a previous idea I made little progress on is about to expire.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## 👟 Running

Switched it up and trying some zero-drop sneakers from Altra.

## 📺 Watching

Revisited _Futurama_, and realized I had never seen the latter half of episodes. Also working through the new season of _How To with John Wilson_, which features the best combination of humor and poignancy.

## 📚 Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_. Slowing making progress on _Your Computer is on Fire_ as well.
