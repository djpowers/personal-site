# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

Starting a new full-time role shortly. Excited to get back to working on products with real users. More to follow.

I'm also focused on building out this site. I initially wanted to do so from scratch, but realized that is not really practical for modern front-end web development. The [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) have been intriguing to me of late, so I decided to leverage [Eleventy 🎈🐀](https://www.11ty.dev/) for basic templating and build steps. It doesn't add any code to the final output that I didn't write, which was a goal of mine.

Leaning into static sites by building out a site for a friend's upcoming podcast using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and assisting another get a blog up and running via [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Will share more when there's something concrete to share. 📰 🎧

## 👟 Running

Getting out for lots of short runs. Exploring lots of desolate backroads when I venture out.

## 📺 Watching

Just began _Lovecraft Country_. After some great reality programming in _Indian Matchmaking_ and _Love on the Spectrum_.

## 📚 Reading

Have been on a non-fiction kick for a while. Just finished [Modern Web Development on the JAMstack](https://www.netlify.com/oreilly-jamstack/), and now partway through "How To Write Funny" by Scott Dikkers.
