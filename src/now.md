# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

Starting a new venture soon, more to follow.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## üëü Running

I ran my first road race since 2019 recently this summer, a local seasonal series I've participated in several times over the years. Despite the gross humidity I ran a decent time.

## üì∫ Watching

After hearing nonstop praise, I began _Ted Lasso_ and timed my finish to Season One to coincide with the start of Season Two.

I'm also eagerly awaiting each release of Secret Base's [The History of the Atlanta Falcons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXSZMIiUfFSzzgEL4N9aYBXPmGVen3zW). (Trust me on this one, even if you have no affiliation with Atlanta, the Falcons, or even football in general.)

## üìö Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_.
