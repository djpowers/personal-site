# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

Full-time work going well. Finally started posting to the [blog](/blog/) section of this site, with more to come.

Hoping to knock out drafts soon for some short humor ideas I've been kicking around. Also overhauling my keyboard shortcuts via the [hyper key](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/hyper-key/), which I hope to write about soon.

## 👟 Running

I've been branching out from my local [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/) course, and have been checking out events in other cities while traveling. Definitely hoping to continue doing so on future trips, schedule permitting.

## 📺 Watching

Running through _Baby Reindeer_ on Netflix. (Feels like I'm already behind even though it just came out, but I digress.)

## 📚 Reading

Picked up _Slow AF Run Club_ by Martinus Evans after going to his book tour stop in Boston. Loved his running philosophy and sense of humor, so excited to crack this one open.
