# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to make your own!)

## 👋 Personal

Getting married next month!

## ✍️ Working

I built out the website for my upcoming wedding, and would not necessarily recommend doing so! It was nice to have full control and implement my own RSVP system, but definitely took a lot of time. Some of the styling left a little bit to be desired as other priorities came up, but It Worked™.

Very happy to soft share that I have accepted a role with the MBTA as a Senior Software Engineer and will be starting very shortly! Looking forward to serving riders and diving into new technologies (namely, Elixir and Phoenix).


## 👟 Running

This year I didn't fill up the calendar with races, and have been using the flexibility to explore different areas during longer runs. Until recently I had inexplicably never been on the [Lower Neponset River Trail](https://www.mass.gov/locations/lower-neponset-river-trail).

## 📺 Watching

I was turned on to _Taskmaster_ by numerous sources, and started Series 19 on a bit of a whim. Such a delightful and silly and wholesome show. The allure of Jason Mantzoukas may have drawn me in, but I grew to love the entire cast.

## 📚 Reading

Focusing on brushing up on some technical topics and books for now.
