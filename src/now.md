# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

If you're interested in open source software development, check out [Upstream](https://upstream.live/register?code=dp22), a virtual conference being put on by my company celebrating open source developers and maintainers.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## üëü Running

Just ran my first twilight 5K race since... possibly ever? Also was a fundraiser not put on by a for-profit events company, which was a refreshing change of pace.

## üì∫ Watching

Started _Severance_ after many recommendations, and it seems very much up my alley. And of course, watching the final season of Better Call Saul, a show which is arguably better than Breaking Bad.

## üìö Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_. Slowing making progress on _Your Computer is on Fire_ as well.
