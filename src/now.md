# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to make your own!)

## 👋 Personal

Got married in 2025, and subsequently traveled to the UK and Europe. Caught the [Edinburgh Festival Fringe](https://www.edfringe.com/), which was a real treat. Still honing my travel gear and over-optimizing my credit card setup.

## ✍️ Working

Happily working as a Software Engineer with in the MBTA Technology Innovation Department! Still learning a bunch and getting acquainted with Elixir and Phoenix.

## 👟 Running

Recently did a fun holiday-themed 5K race. No races planned as of now, but hoping to continue doing parkrun events, completing more courses and challenges.

## 📺 Watching

Thrilled to have a new Vince Gilligan show to watch in _Pluribus_. Just about wrapped up, and appreciating the companion podcast as well.

## 📚 Reading

Focusing on brushing up on some technical topics and books for now. Happy to see Kobo support Instapaper now to easily save longreads to my device.
