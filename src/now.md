# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

New stuffs in the works. Numerous domains for potential side projects have been purchased, so you know things are serious.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## üëü Running

It has been cold out, but I don't mind it?

## üì∫ Watching

I just finished the Cecil Hotel documentary on Netflix. I somehow never heard that story, and was certainly engaged as it unfolded. Some questionable editorial decisions by the producers, but the fascinating case makes up for it. Also I couldn't get over the hotel manager reminding me of [Kim Wexler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Wexler).

Strong recommend for the recently released [Patrice O'Neal documentary](https://patriceoneal.com/#documentary). He was one of my favorite comedians, and I think this does him justice.

## üìö Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_.
