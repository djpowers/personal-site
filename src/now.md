# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to make your own!)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

On the search for full-time work. If you're looking for a Senior Software Engineer with a background in full-stack web development, please [reach out on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davejpowers/).

I've also just launched the initial version of my wedding website!

## üëü Running

This winter, I appreciated having some actual cold weather and a bit of snow. Looking forward to spring, and will likely mix up the race calendar this year to try some new courses.

## üì∫ Watching

Restarted the Apple TV+ subscription solely for the new season of _Severance_, which has been great so far. Very nice to have an appointment viewing show for the first time in quite a while. Also correcting the fact that I had never watched _Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt_, which is reaffirming my belief that anything Tina Fey is involved in is excellent.

## üìö Reading

Focusing on brushing up on some technical topics and books for now.
