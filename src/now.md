# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

New stuffs in the works. Numerous domains for potential side projects have been purchased, so you know things are serious.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## 👟 Running

It has been cold out, but I don't mind it?

## 📺 Watching

SOMEONE has been rewatching _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_, and I've thusly caught a number of episodes by proximity. Watching it growing up, I don't think I realized how odd it is. Go Fighting Scallions!

## 📚 Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_.
