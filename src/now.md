# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

Recently made the jump from Vim to Neovim and doing a lot of configuration tweaking. Also trying to revise and polish up some humor drafts I've been sitting on for a while.

## 👟 Running

Enjoying the beginning of the best running season, and trying to queue up a few races through the end of the year.

## 📺 Watching

Working my way through _The Bear_, which is great. Excellent soundtrack as well. Also slowly making it through _Never Have I Ever_ from Mindy Kaling.

## 📚 Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_. Also picked up Bob Odenkirk's _Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama_ which I need to get started on.
