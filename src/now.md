# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## üíâ Vaccination

I have officially received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. You can read my quote about it in this [Boston Globe article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/04/06/metro/states-new-covid-19-eligibility-rules-open-flood-gates-people-seek-vaccinations/), if you're so inclined. (Please ignore the judgmental tone, and just get vaccinated as soon as you're eligible.)

If you're in Massachusetts and trying to sign up a family member, friend, or yourself, [this guide](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2021/03/24/massachusetts-vaccine-appointment-tips/) was generally helpful. The CVS at midnight approach seemed most effective, if you don't mind putting in the effort.

### DAYS UNTIL DAVE IS CONSIDERED FULLY VACCINATED:

## ‚úçÔ∏è Working

New stuffs in the works. Numerous domains for potential side projects have been purchased, so you know things are serious.

Leaning into static sites, I also built out a site for a friend's new podcast that automatically builds new pages as new episodes are published, and also adds blogging capabilities: [The Boys Are Back In Time](https://theboysarebackintime.com/).

## üëü Running

Looking forward to Spring weather after the recent glimpses we've seen.

## üì∫ Watching

Still slowly working through _Unsolved Mysteries_.

## üìö Reading

Just cracked open _How to Write One Song_ by Jeff Tweedy. Upon completion I will be penning my non-fiction debut, _How to Read One Book_.
