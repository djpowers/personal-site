# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

<mark>Searching for my next opportunity! If you have any leads, you can [reach out on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davejpowers/) (feel free to mention you came from this site).</mark>

I'm also focused on building out this site. I initially wanted to do so from scratch, but realized that is not really practical for modern front-end web development. The [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) have been intriguing to me of late, so I decided to leverage [Eleventy 🎈🐀](https://www.11ty.dev/) for basic templating and build steps. It doesn't add any code to the final output that I didn't write, which was a goal of mine.

Leaning into static sites by building out a site for a friend's upcoming podcast using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and assisting another get a blog up and running via [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Will share more when there's something concrete to share. 📰 🎧

## 👟 Running

This likely need not be stated, but running with a mask on is very annoying. My mileage is low, but I'm exploring lots of desolate backroads when I get out.

## 📺 Watching

Finally started watching _Barry_, after many suggestions (my girlfriend will note that it took two more recommendations after hers for me to start). Also working through Mindy Kaling's new show _Never Have I Ever_. For some reason, I've also found myself watching through early 00's sitcom _Grounded For Life_.

## 📚 Reading

Have been on a non-fiction kick for a while. Just finished [Modern Web Development on the JAMstack](https://www.netlify.com/oreilly-jamstack/), and now partway through "How To Write Funny" by Scott Dikkers.
