      <h2>Who am I?!</h2>

      <p>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/dave_powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@dave_powers</a>, a web developer, humor writer, and interrobang advocate. Check out what I'm up to <a href="now.html">now</a>.</p>

      <p>I like simple, modern, websites. This one is being built out from scratch with no frameworks or libraries to keep things as light as possible. If you're curious, here's what I like to <a href="uses.html">use</a>.</p>

      <p>Check out some of my <a href="writing.html">writing</a> if you'd like. You may have seen some of my humor published on <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/dave-powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McSweeney's</a>, <a href="https://www.pointsincase.com/author/dave-powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Points in Case</a>, or <a href="https://medium.com/@dave_powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slackjaw via Medium</a>.

        <p>I grew up in the 'burbs of Boston, and bounce around Somerville and Cambridge these days. You may catch me in one of the many squares seeing a show, grabbing a beer, or <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/01/man-who-bumped-into-bank-robbery-suspect-says-was-position-react/c7AV2FzhgOBq1iiifW0zpI/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disarming a bank robber</a>.
