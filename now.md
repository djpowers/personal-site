# Now

(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). Feel free to [make your own](https://nownownow.com/about)).

## ✍️ Working

I'm currently focused on building out this site. I initially wanted to build this one out from scratch, but realized that is not really practical for modern front-end web development. The [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) have been intriguing to me of late, so I decided to leverage [Eleventy 🎈🐀](https://www.11ty.dev/) for basic templating and build steps. It doesn't add any code to the final output that I didn't write, which was a goal of mine.

Also trying to help one friend start a blog and another build out a podcast site. Will share when there's something to share. 📰 🎧

## 👟 Running

I've eased up on the mileage after [running the NYC Marathon](https://results.nyrr.org/event/M2019/result/12697) last fall. Looking forward to running the BAA 5K next.

## 📺 Watching

The only show I watch in (near) real-time is Better Call Saul, which is back. I'm very close to declaring it as good as Breaking Bad. I'm also slowly making my way back through Portlandia, one of the best sketch shows of the last decade.

## 📚 Reading

Have been on a non-fiction kick for a while. Working through [Modern Web Development on the JAMstack](https://www.netlify.com/oreilly-jamstack/) and "How To Write Funny" by Scott Dikkers.
